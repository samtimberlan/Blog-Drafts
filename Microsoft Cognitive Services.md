Microsoft Cognitive Services
Text Analytics: examines semantics and determines sentiments from text. Provides more information than analyzing individual words. It aggregates key phrases using various techniques including Stemming. Stemming takes into cognizance that multiple words may come from a common stem, for example, plays, player, are from the base word ‘play’.

Bing Speech API: is used to work with speech based on languages. Translations could be made and text converted to speech with it.

Language Understanding Intelligence Service (LUIS): this cognitive service identifies user intent in speech. This intent is mapped to entities. This service offers IOTs like Alexa and Siri, the ability to understand commands and trigger appropriate responses. For instance, the words “Turn On the Air Conditioner” would translate to Air Conditioner as the entity and On, the intent. This would turn on the air conditioner.
